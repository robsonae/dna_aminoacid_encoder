# dna_aminoacid_encoder
A simple code which converts a DNA sequence into the corresponding AA sequences

### This code:
1. reads a nucleotide sequence from a FASTA file (limit - one sequence per file)
2. calculates the percentages of the nucleotides
3. translates the sequence into the corresponding amino-acid sequence in all 6 Open Reading Frames
4. calculates the molar mass of each AA chain for each ORF
5. writes all the results to a .txt file
